I'm trying to think of an idea for a project utilising Python and Full Stack, but the only idea I've got so far is a Twitter bot that emulated Bossman's hatred of printers. As for how Full Stack would play into the equation, I have no idea right now.

Is such a thing even <i>possible</i>?

I hope so.
